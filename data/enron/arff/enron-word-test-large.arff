then make some comment on the confirm you sent me both secur law comment and other comment the princip secur law issu relat to the fact that the equiti deriv itself is a secur and to the issu of whether and to what extent a counterparty01 activ in establish or unwind a hedg are attribut to the issuer when enron enter into a deriv and the counterparti goe out into the market to make a purchas is that purchas attribut to enron when it unwind it hedg by make a sale is the counterparty01 sale attribut to enron and therefor requir to be regist here are the princip issu 1 rule 10b5 when enron enter into a deriv it must be sure it doe not have undisclos materi insid inform regard it affair it is my understand that the trader are suppos to check with rex roger on the issu of whether enron possess such inform although it could discharg it oblig under rule 10b5 by disclos the inform to the counterparti that would probabl be unaccept sinc the counterparti would then be in possess of materi insid inform and could not engag in a market transact to hedg thus each time it enter into an equiti deriv in it own stock enron must be confid that the public has avail to it all materi inform regard enron 2 rule 10b18 this rule permit issuer and person act in concert with issuer to repurchas the issuer01 share under a 01safe harbor018 that say in effect tha t if purchas are made pursuant to the rule they won01t be deem to be manipul by reason of the tim ing and amount of the bid or purchas it is typic for an issuer to requir it counterparti to make purchas pursuant to the rule sometim this is a contractu undertak in the confirm and in some case the issuer will simpli obtain an oral commit from the counterparti to engag in it hedg pursuant to the rule obvious it is better to have it in write 3 registr of sale if enron decid to net share settl and issu share to the counterparti those are obvious restrict secur that cannot be sold by the counterparti in the absenc of a registr statement but what about the resal by the issuer when it unwind it hedg that it has put on by buy share in the open market are those sale attribut to the issuer so therefor requir to be regist i have seen lot of counterparti base on advic of their law firm take differ posit on this a some counterparti say that they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer if the econom of the deriv are determin base on the net proceed from the sale it 01s a more difficult case becaus the issuer itself is realiz benefit and detriment from the sale b some counterparti say they want registr right cover resal of share purchas in the open market to hedg a deriv with the issuer onli if there is a strong correl at the onset of the contract between the term of the deriv and the hedg it it01 a total return swap for exampl there will be a 11 correspond ie the econom will tell you that the counterparti will buy 100 of the share cover by the swap immedi upon enter into the swap but if it01 someth like a collar with diverg strike price and involv dynam hedg where it01 not clear whether and to what extent the counterparti will make purchas or sale in the ope n market then it01 not as easi to attribut the counterparty01 action to the issuer in those case these counterparti look at the correl and if it01 not that great they don01t ask for registr right c some counterparti say they don01t want registr right for resa les of stock purchas in the open market to hedg their posit credit suiss first boston fall in categori c with respect to the may 200 0 confirm you sent me even though there is a strong correl between the deal and the hedg e ie even though in that case they will no doubt immedi purchas 100 of the share cover by the transact they are onli ask for registr right with respect to the share that are deliv by enron on net share settlement 4 commod law under the commod law there are some risk in do equiti swap in that one has to reli on the swap polici statement rather than the swap exempt but those risk are probabl minim enough that enron is will to take them the swap exempt doe not cover equiti swap with respect to equiti option they are outsid the cftc01s jurisdict altogeth forward contract present the most difficult issu in that there is a lot of case law and cftc lore about the distinct between forward and futur and a key distinct is that forward are physic deliveri contract that bind the parti to make and take deliveri state bucket shop law outlaw contract that purport to be contract for sale of a secur that are to be settl base on market price quotat so i would counsel enron not to enter into ani forward contract that has a cash settlement altern although one can argu that net share settlement has the same defect i don01t feel as strong about that bec aus you could get to where you want to get by physic deliv the share and issu new share s in payment the theori is that you actual deliv share and just net them out that is not quit as bad as fli in the face of the case law and cftc lore on net cash settlement the bear stearn confirm and cancel i realli don01t have ani comment on this i think the cancel was effect to cancel the parti oblig the confirm did not present ani registr issu i guess i would say that if you do someth precisel y like this you might get them to agre to make ani hedg purchas pursuant to rule 10b18 but that01 it the credit suiss first boston confirm this is an extrem well written document for the reason discuss abov i would counsel against enter into this kind of transact with the cash settlement featur in light of the risk that it could be character as an illeg unenforc futur contract a few other comment they say automat earli termin appli but i think that is a realli bad idea enron had an agreement with a counterparti that took bankruptci and enron did not find out about it until a few day later after the market had move sinc enron di d not know of the termin it did not unwind it hedg yet the isda said that the amount payabl on termin would depend on the termin date price so enron took a loss you ought to alway have within your control the right to termin this is especi true of us parti but i would think the same would appli to foreign parti unless there is someth peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio n you are deal with both confirm both confirm have languag that say that if the parti have not enter into an isda master then the counterparties01 standard form control i think it is not a good idea to agre to such languag becaus you are agre to someth you know noth about addit comment i think that whenev a counterparti request registr right rex should be involv i think the csfb confirmation01 provis relat to registr are fine and of cours they can01t forc us to regist becaus the choic of net share settl is pure our choic nevertheless i think that rex need to be involv so you and rex need to get this point across to the busi peopl that they shouldn01t just sign a confirm and then send it to you and ask if it is ok but my bottom line is the onli chang i would make would be elimin the net cash settlement featur in the csfb

the fund can be oner and timeconsum negoti more paperwork is not a viabl option from the credit side as we understand it the issu w not backtoback the trade w ena is that the credit exposur will not be aggreg to the fund net posit in houston and therefor not monitor in other word ani exposur not sit w ena will be invis to credit so daili margin etc will be incorrect from the enrononlin side as we

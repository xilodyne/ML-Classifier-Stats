believ the deal stay with him at enron if these deal stay with enron should they be at ee sinc they are behind the cityg or do they stay with enron to reduc the tco deliveri to the cityg for ces this could be a can of worm colleen what is the contract interrupt doe the cityg product deal stay with enron if they stay with enron then doe ces realiz this are the produc receiv two payment one from enron and one from ces mayb this has alreadi be discuss and decid but i havent heard the offici word current these cityg product deal are deduct from the cityg deliveri that ces need the number that herndon ldc schedul provid to enron are reduc by the product i think  put these buysel in the system to appeas john and keep the enron account system whole current the market demand ticket in sitara are reduc by the cityg suppli the path could be made easier by hook up the cityg product suppli to the market demand ticket but the market demand number need to be increas then you could elimin the buysel ticket that   has been creat howev if this product gas is not enron then enron is creat a lot of unnecessari work and the produc are probabl receiv two payment from katherin l kelli ect

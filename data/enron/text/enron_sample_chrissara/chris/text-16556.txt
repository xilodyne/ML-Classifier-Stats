to own power plant electr util naturalga pipelin and liquefiednaturalga facil but littl els the biggest properti would be the portland general electr util in oregon elektro a sao paulobas brazilian util and about 15000 mile of pipelin asset on both contin less than half the amount of pipe that enron onc possess the plan would essenti make the enron successor littl differ from other us energi compani that provid electr and natur gas give it few advantag over competitor it would also make the new compani more reliant than ever on volatil south american oper at a time when it us rival are scale back their commit in the region nevertheless enron new manag team head sinc januari by restructur specialist stephen cooper hope that the creation of a new compani will protect the asset it need from a long bankruptcyreorgan process that could hurt their valu under the compani plan all of enron other asset would be liquid in that process the number of employe would drop steepli from about 23000 today alreadi down from a peak of 31000 befor the bankruptci to around 12000 in my view were go to be in bankruptci for a number of year becaus of the difficulti were go to have resolv all of the claim mr cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon after enron board had met to go over the plan a spinoff he said also could protect the new busi from problem stem from the bankruptci such as custom wari of enter into new contract and a welter of litig and compet claim custom who otherwis might shun enron could embrac the new compani mr cooper predict onc were out from under what they will see is a compani with great asset and great cash flow that can stand on it own two leg enron creditor wield enorm influenc over how the bankruptci reorgan will unfold mr cooper and his advis will have to convinc these unsecur creditor who have assert billion of dollar in claim that they stand to recov more of their money by turn enron core asset into a new compani than sell them off in a fire sale becaus enron now owe a fiduciari oblig to them these creditor have the power to press the compani to alter the plan consider or to proceed direct to a liquid the creditor committe has a bunch of bright reason businesspeopl on it said mr cooper their goal to maxim valu is consist with our im confid that we will be abl to make a case for valu maxim by adopt this approach luc despin a lawyer for the creditor committe said he hadnt yet seen the plan and couldnt comment protract negoti are like to follow the friday meet if and when enron reach an accord with creditor enron will file the plan with the bankruptci court which must then approv it the propos reorgan would sweep away a decad of rapid growth return the compani to it size in 1992 when former chairman kenneth lay and thenpresid richard kinder were run the compani four year later mr kinder left enron and was replac by jeffrey skill under whose leadership the compani began to disparag hard asset and emphas the energytrad busi that eventu turn enron into a far larger concern whether the new compani can escap the taint of enron is far from certain the success of opco as a go concern will depend on it abil to separ reput from enron the draft busi plan say in addit to win support from creditor enron must disentangl itself from mani complic financi arrang and an exist agreement to sell portland general electr to northwest natur gas co a deal which hasnt yet close in recent month new manag have devot consider energi to tri to understand enron complic financi arrang they are also tri to unravel the content of a plethora of spes or specialpurpos entiti they were creat begin in the mid1990 as a way to pump up profit hide debt and rais money from outsid investor the draft plan contain a list of asset enron wish to retain for the new compani some of which may be entangl in these specialpurpos entiti for exampl centraga a pipelin compani in colombia is a propos asset of the new compani but separ intern spreadsheet review by the wall street journal show that control interest of that pipelin alreadi had been pledg to two invest vehicl rawhid lp and whitew lp they in turn may have pass along interest to other enron entiti tombston asset llc and ponderosa asset lp the compani said it is tri to unwind mani of the invest vehicl to gain clear titl to the asset for the new compani but it caution that the unwind and resolut of these structur may affect the financi result present for the new compani if the new compani is creat as outlin it pro forma net incom base on past perform of the unit it hope to retain is project to be 243 million this year 352 million next year 450 million in 2004 and 503 million by 2005 that is base on asset of 101 billion current rise to 11 billion by 2003 that a far cri from what enron claim at it peak in 2000 the last year that full financi record were post by the compani enron said it net incom was 979 million on 1008 billion in revenu those number as well as financi statement in the previous three year were eventu retract as enron came under increas scrutini from investor and regul the plan said the compani want to keep enough asset to form the basi of a new compani becaus the market is alreadi overload with properti for sale and price arent veri good enron collaps is part to blame for that market glut becaus credit standard have been tighten forc

calp for both the prepetit and the postpetit reserv charg not paid by ena and the full charg from the effect date of the capac recal by my count those amount are 13106320 prepetit and 36242300 postpetit or about 35 of tcos prepetit and postpetit claim ex paragraph 5 8 9 6 paragraph 6 is mislead on novemb 30 2001 ena nomin a 10000 dthd nomin for decemb 1st through 31st or a total of 310000 dth the entir balanc of park gas under pal k 67401 this agreement was go to termin on decemb 31 2001 and ena want to zero out the balanc by the termin date tco refus to accept the nomin so the ratabl gas deliveri of 10000 dthday for 31 day were not schedul into ena pool account with tco and could not be sold in the decemb 2001 spot gas market interest tco continu to invoic ena for the pal charg even though tco was hold our gas ex exhibit c 7 ena also tri to nomin a portion of the park gas 10000 dthday on januari 2nd for gas day januari 3rd deliveri onc again tco did not accept ena nomin and no park gas was schedul for januari 3rd the end result was that the park gas could not be use as a sourc of gas suppli to perform under an exist sale agreement with columbia of ohio one of the mani sale agreement in ena portfolio of contract 8 ena continu to be invoic commod charg under the ig agreement for the postpetit period this lead to the question what has tco done with ena gas that the small produc have been deliv into ena ig agreement and whi have we not seen ani account of these volum i am miss one month invoic but i am guess that the volum should be around 62000 to 77000 dth i will have to get this nail down monday morn also volum that are nongath are aggreg separ tco would have to provid this volum inform 9 for the postpetit period ee has been use it fts sst sit and ig contract in order to continu to serv it market ee has been pay the pipelin either month or on a prepay basi see exhibit h ee chart 10 i doubt the pipelin allow ee to continu to do busi without provid adequ assur of perform ex paragraph 11 21 i will have to check on monday what exact was done 11 sinc ee has been use their capac and pay their bill dure the postpetit period i do not understand how tco can both accept nomin for eess pool gas and freez the pool balanc simultan ex paragraph 12 i will have to get more info from ee on monday 12 valu of pool gas should be at current condit ex paragraph 13 exact opposit of the price support to the argument in paragraph 21 has actual occur 13 exhibit h show the suppos 210446331 revenu that will be lost by tco as a result of ee breach it contract contract breach onc again ee continu to use and pay the invoic for it contract sinc the petit date wouldnt it be like for this situat to continu until the end of the term of the agreement or that these agreement could be assign or releas to anoth parti if it is decid that ee termin it retail sale off tco ex paragraph 14 ena eess respons to tco round ii motion 1 assum i am correct on the ee pool ena and eess situat are complet differ and in the major of the case should not be lump togeth generic as debtor or the estat 2 loan are made for a varieti of reason eg imbal manag tco want to reduc it current line pack or inventori etc paragraph 6 3 onc again hold eess pool gas doe not make sens sinc ee appear to be all paid up i will get this confirm monday morn paragragh 1 2 4 7 9 10 14 15 16 17 21 4 for the first time that we can recal tco is also use sec 97 of their tariff to also address the issu of storag custom who are outsid the contractu limit of their storag agreement   just sent out a notic where tco announc a gas sale auction to sell off a small volum of gas that fell in this categori the volum was so small it is hard to believ that tco could even see it in their daytoday oper my guess is they are tri to set a preced to make a point paragraph 26 27 28 29 30 5 notic to suspend perform on account of nonpay i do not know if written notic were sent to ena i will have to check legal termin letter file on monday morn for ee sinc they are pay i dont know how they can be includ in this argument  and robin both talk with tco when the nomin were not accept suppos

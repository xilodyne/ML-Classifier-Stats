here is the updat 1 boni is get a legal opinion on the adr issuanc and is in contact with millenium attorney 2 dkb has perform investig on whether these adr must be restrict dkbs view is that they should not restrict this is high arcan us sec law so my summari is probabl miss a lot of finer point but my understand is that dkb view the sale of the local share as a real sale with a public notic a public underwritten auction etcand there is noth restrict about the share i dont think boni would disput that but i think their interpret and our legal view is that the share are restrict becaus they are share that were not regist with the sec under the origin adr issuanc and critic they were sold by the issuer that is boni view is that bndes is the same as millenium bc they are both govern entitiesi bndes is the issuer therefor regardless of the public natur of sale of the share and the fact that the share arent restrict for trade local in brazil the share issu as adr would be restrict per us law now ultim we have to go with what boni say bc they issu the adr howev befor we charg back to boni and argu dkbs case i would appreci a review by skadden back to me on whether these share if issu as adr would be restrict we want unrestrict nyse adr if possibl 3 when the adr are issu they will be issu to pep a brazil compani but deposit in one of the cayco parent of pep custodi account we will need to check brazil law and revis our ms custodi account accord to se eif we can do this  again i will tri to call tomorrow i apolog for the delay 4 the plan to move the adr out of brazil is as follow there will be no sale and no cash movement there may be a cpmf pep will perform an inkind capit reduct of the share back to it cayco parent this will probabl requir some brazil govern approv or may not if so what are they and how long will they take 5 critic we have been advis by brazil legal and by us tax that the share if move in this manner will move at the origin cost basi ie there is no taxbal event for us or brazil lynn pleas confirm 6 i dont have a timet yet i will call boni tomorrow for an updat on time regard bruce lynn aven 120799 0714 am to bruce

i dont want to take ani chanc with the brazil tax author better to move the share now when the price is pretti even than to move it later when the price has doubl it would be a tempt tax target regard

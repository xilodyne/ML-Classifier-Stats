zippercorpenronenron danieldiamondenroncom subject re hedg fund and cta list bob our issu with hedg fund are somewhat complic the threshold issu is that they are sever limit by their fundament document the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in so we have to review those document befor trade that is more than we do for runofthemil domest corpor and take a lot of legal resourc that so far have been spent elsewher the other issu is more difficult becaus it is hard to peg down and relat to regulatori uncertainti about a year ago a major hedg fund long term capit got into serious troubl and the regul step in orchestr a bailout there was much wring of hand and gnash of teeth in washington afterward and sinc then there have been a varieti of messag come out of washington relat to deriv trade with hedg fund none of them good our view is that the regul will be pay much closer attent to hedg fund trade of deriv than in the past and we dont want that spotlight shine on us in case your interest notwithstand their name hedg fund are specul much of the feder regul of deriv has assum that hedg as oppos to specul was safer and therefor more palat the failur of a larg hedg fund might result in damag rippl effect throughout the financi market henc the regul heighten scrutini for both of these reason when enrononlin was launch it was with the intern state polici that we would not give access to hedg fund or individu for similar reason commod trade advisor can not trade on enrononlin on behalf of their custom just as broker cannot mark bob shult 12122000 1026 am to

each and the top hedg fund base upon their likelihood to manag asset in diversifi market that may includ tangibl commod my understand of eol is that it present cater primarili to this latter group and offer onli tangibl commod trade instrument as i explain the principl differ between a hedg fund and a cta commod trade advisor is the manner in which they control the asset that they are contract to manag in the case of a cta the money can not be held by the cta itself the under investor will open a clear account with a respect clear hous the asset will remain in this account and the cta will trade base on the full monetari valu of that account in mani case an investor may well fund this account with notion fund nf are abstract fund not actual deposit at the clear hous but acknowledg as be avail should variat or origin margin be requir the cta has no control over these fund all monetari transact must be execut by the clear hous and must be author by the investor the cta doe have the abil to execut trade at an other trade hous such as enron through a contractu document call an intern uniform giveup agreement we have quit a few hundr of these agreement in ny essenti all parti involv in the execut of a trade the cta the investor the execut broker and the clear hous agre to allow the cta to trade wherev hesh wish and giveup that trade to the investor clear hous sinc everi regul trade must ultim clear the respect exchang for a cta to trade otc and swap agreement would requir prior notif to an investor that hisher money may be requir as collater against such a trade and would be requir to be deposit at enron a hedg fund has greater flexibl to trade such instrument sinc in the major of instanc a hedg fund doe exert control over the fund it manag a hedg fund typic structur it invest vehicl as offshor limit partnership fund as such the hedg fund has direct control over the under asset and can move those asset to wherev they may be requir if invest via enron onlin it would move the asset to enron for exampl this first list below is compris of the top flight ctas the follow list is of hedg fund that i believ are trade commod and other nonsecur invest it is

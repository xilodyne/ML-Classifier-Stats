cover by that issu hereinaft the framework for account that is establish in this issu is refer to as the model 1 initi balanc sheet classif the initi balanc sheet classif general is base on the concept that contract that requir net cash settlement are asset or liabil and contract that requir settlement in share are equiti instrument if the contract provid the compani with a choic of net cash settlement or settlement in share the model assum settlement in share if the contract provid the counterparti with a choic of net cash settlement or settlement in share the model assum net cash settlement howev this model is not applic when settlement altern do not have the same econom valu attach to them or when one of the settlement altern is fix or contain cap or floor in those situat the account for the instrument or combin of instrument should be base on the econom substanc of the transaction1 1 for exampl if a freestand contract issu togeth with anoth instrument requir that the issuer provid to the holder a fix or guarante return such that the instrument are insubst debt the issuer should account for both instrument as liabil regardless of the settlement term of the freestand contract accord unless the econom substanc indic otherwis contract would be initi classifi as equiti or as asset or liabil in the follow situat equiti instrument contract that requir physic

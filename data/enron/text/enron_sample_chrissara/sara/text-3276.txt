emjapan trader you were alreadi copi on this but i want to make sure 20 that you got it 20 in this email i explain that pwctokyo has recommend follow a20 depend agent approach for these trader which is what you refer in 20 your attach email i recommend this approach say that it is a20 pragmat approach and should be easili implement i talk with sheila 20 glover and darren delag about this approach yesterday even and they lik e20 it as well in fact they were also copi on the email regard the fx 20 trader and the emjapan trader the follow point should be kept in mind in follow the depend agen t20 approach which i have alreadi discuss with sheila and darren 1 agenc approach enron japan would be consid to be an agent of ena 20 in this role it would facilit trade that would be enter into between 20 ena and the third parti counterparti the trade would be enter into i n20 the name of ena under this approach darren is limit in what he is20 author to do and his trade paramet will need to be reduc to20 write these paramet must restrict his activ so that they20 constitut activ that have a preparatori or auxiliari charact the 20 advic that we receiv for the fx trader activ in australia should 20 equal appli to our fact here the follow is an excerpt from a memo 20 that i wrote last year summar this advic guidelin and boundari must be establish on what the financi trader 20 can do eg price paramet product paramet etc activ cannot 20 includ the negoti of term of master contract forward and other20 deriv with counterparti if a master contract must be execut in 20 australia then it should be execut by an independ agent such as a20 lawyer have a power of attorney from the hedg parti confirmations20 should be issu by the hedg parti rather than by ea financ in sydney 20 the australian tax advisor recommend that the financi trader say 01 my20 princip will deal with you within these paramet 01018 2 darren employ darren must be consid an employe of enron20 japan so as to avoid ena be treat as have a perman establish in20 japan 3 darren agenc role darren should not identifi himself as an employ e20 of ena houston he should make it clear that the third parti are enterin g20 into the transact with ena as princip 4 servic agreement a servic agreement must be put in place between20 enron japan and ena similar to what we did for the fx trader in sydney 20 enron japan should at least initi be compens at a cost plus 520 markup yesterday even i also forward to sheila and darren by email 20 the old servic agreement that we put in place for the fx trader in sydney so20 that they could review what term have been previous use incident 20 the servic agreement we put in place between enron australia and ena was 20 veri similar almost ident to the one that was put in place between20 enron europ and ena for the fx trader in london 5 potenti issu upon japanes tax audit notwithstand that this20 approach is easier to implement more workabl and more pragmat in20 approach we need to be awar that there could be question upon a japanes 20 tax audit in that event transfer price issu could be rais that i s20 the auditor could question whether a cost plus 5 markup is commensur 20 with what an unrel third parti would charg for similar servic we 20 would then need to justifi that servic fee or if unsuccess tri to wor k20 out a commiss fee that would be accept to the japanes tax auditor 20 manag need to be awar of this potenti i guess i wasnt clear in my attach email i am sorri for any20 inconveni this may have caus you i hope this email better explain 20 the recommend structur pleas let me know if you would like to set up a20 confer call to discuss this further and let me know who you would like 20 on the call best regard susan susan musch 12132000 0607 pm to

20 not use a depend agent structur in japan pwc has advis that20 although baker mckenzi approach is more technic correct foreign 20 trader usual set up their japanes trade oper through the use of a20 depend agent in japan the japanes depend agent is usual reimbur ed20 use cost plus 5 at least initi then if the japanes tax20 author rais question upon audit a commiss arrang is general ly20 use with the question be what should the profit split be between the 20 agent and the foreign compani whether the japanes tax author rais 20 question upon audit is depend upon the volum of trade and the magnitu de20 of the trade the pwc japanes tax partner suggest that we use this20 arrang for both the fx trader and the em japan trade i have ask p wc20 to send this advic in write by tomorrow this

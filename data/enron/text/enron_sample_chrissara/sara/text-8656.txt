upon me that there was a quagmir of addit tax and potenti regulatori sfa issu pleas comment also as a commerci effici cours of action it has alway seem to me that we should attempt to train our couterparti to accept that ectric is also a enron corp guarante sub at least it was in the past at their request and somehow initi set up our contractsisda to be inclus of this vehicl is this possibl

jeffrey a cc abramo carolin zivic robyn diamond daniel radous paul lebrocq wendi sharma shifali juggin janin nelson roderick subject re trade as ena russel my view would be to follow the novat rout ie 1 cp trade via eol with ectric 2 each trade is novat from ectric to ena and treat as conclud under ena isda master 3 ena enter into backtoback trade with ectric this doe mean that the cp must initi accept the european eol gtcs though if we set up a mechan wherebi eol trade are automat novat to ena and treat as conclud under the ena isda master this effect cancel out the eol gtcs justin origin

as ena everyon our hedg fund group need clarif on the issu of do brent and other european product deal w our hedg fund counterparti and book them back to ena the entiti with which all the fund have isda we just did two wtibrent crude oil spread today one w veri larg volum and expect to be do more such deal this is more than just a legal issu it go to impact credit and our strategi to get the fund trade on eol as well as we understand it the main legal issu is that all the fund have an isda onli w ena and not w ectric so they and i assum we want all deal and legal exposur to be w ena to satisfi both parti desir all european product deal must be book from ectric to ena  from speak to you and from justin respons below it seem to me that the onli legal hurdl we the fund and our trader might face is if no trader w ena in houston okay w the counterparti on ena behalf howev there seem to be 2 other solut a net agreement and novat that get around this as  know deal on legal agreement w the fund can be oner and timeconsum negoti more paperwork is not a viabl option from the credit side as we understand it the issu w not backtoback the trade w ena is that the credit exposur will not be aggreg to the fund net posit in houston and therefor not monitor in other word ani exposur not sit w ena will be invis to credit so daili margin etc will be incorrect from the enrononlin side as we see it there are a coupl of issu eol want the fund to trade onlin an increas number of fund also want to trade onlin howev they do not want to be restrict to trade product that are onli us base also they would like to see more arb spread product like a wtibrent crude oil spread onlin if neither desir can be easili met bc we need a separ isda w ectric which potenti mean as abov more oner and timeconsum negoti then it will certain be detriment for volum and also foresak a certain momentum that we are gain now the point has been rais that the fund could trade european product if credit in london clear them and if they were will then to accept the general term and condit that pop up on eol we can assur you that they will not accept this these are the issu as we see them from the origin side there may be other issu that were miss from the side that ive mention as well as the tradingback offic side regard russ origin messag from white bill sent thursday septemb 27 2001 332 pm to dyk

25 juli 2001 1929 to beyhum maya boyd justin cc sharma shifali klar guenther sexton camill watt juli subject re trade as ena i assum that these are financi transact the current approach is the right one in the circumst ie trade between ectric and ena trade between ena and third parti eg bank of america it is import that the trader agre to the deal with the third parti in the name of ena is locat in houston they cannot agre deal in the name of ena when locat in london the price should be such that ena is compens for take the credit risk with respect to the third parti but otherwis all the econom should be with ectric to avoid book the back to back trade a possibl would be an agreement on net to be enter into by ectric ena and bank of america if all parti can get comfort with the legal posit anoth altern sometim put forward is that ectric doe the deal with bank of america the contract is then novat from ectric to ena and ena enter into a back to back swap on the same financi term with ectric note that we are current work on a project to enter into financi through efet llc arrang by eeft instead of ectric effect 1 novemb regard janin origin messag from beyhum maya sent 25 juli

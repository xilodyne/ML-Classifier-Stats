isda master agreement 1 credit matrix and 2 threshold amount dear john jonathan and i met with ibj today to tri and push our negoti through to the end they are still unwil to do a csa with us but veri signific their back mid offic is current look at get system support in place which would permit them to do a csa with us in due cours they acknowledg to us of their own volit that the market trend is toward csas even in transact where the counter parti is not a bank they did say though that it would be a few month befor they would be set up to do so pls note that they did not agre to do a csa with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knock at some stage to ask them to do it so i think we have gone as far as we can on this for now we will therefor move forward on the credit matrix in the meantim if you are still will to do so the bank has a credit rate of a so i guess this mean us15 million credit limit on the assumpt that it is possibl to draft these term into a contract without a full csa i wonder who is best to do this draft i should be abl to do the negoti but i am not sure that i am abl to do the draft alan do you have ani suggest most of the other issu are sort now but they still want to chang the threshold amount definit to us10 million is there ani flexibl on this thank jane mcbride john suttleect 09272000 1239 am to jonathan

brucejoneslonectect subject re fw ibj isda master agreement jonathan one thing we might be abl to propos is a credit matrix which prescrib a credit line under which each counterparti can transact with collater right and collater threshold tie to the credit rate of each counterparti we have use credit matrix in sever contract here and they are appeal in that there are no materi advers chang mac claus this is appeal to the counterparti in that we cannot automat drop their collater threshold to zero when a mac occur we are comfort becaus as the counterparti credit qualiti deterior the amount of exposur to which we are subject decreas i would propos to ibj someth like the follow in lieu of a full csa jane and john is it possibl to draft these collateralcredit term into the contract without use a full csa i think everi matrix i have use here has been part of a csa rate sp credit line aa or abov 20mm bbb to aa 15mm bbb 10mm bbb 7mm bb to bb 5mm below bb 1mm these term are subject to negoti onc again the matrix remov mac claus and the stress counterparti associ with such but effect reduc the potenti exposur we have or they have to a counterparti with diminish credit qualiti what

to consid propos a solut that doe not involv a csa i propos to meet with them again to tri and explor whi but i would like to be prepar to offer them a solut wherebi we dont enter into a csa and we would limit the type of trade that we could enter into with ibj my feel is that we would be unlik to enter into ani long term transact over 2 year at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship go as i am not sure they are go to budg on this issu yet they appear to be quit will to discuss all the other point we can alway press for a renegoti at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deal i also want to keep the loan facil complet separ what are your thought on this and what limit would you want to put on trade if we do not have a csa thank jonathan john

they have the system capabl to handl the requisit activ relat to the csa as we understand that they util same with certain financi institut counterparti we express our view on these matter and also rais other issu that we had discuss in our recent confer call ibj inform us that they have never enter into a csa with a nonfinanci institut counterparti and my respons was that enron can then be the first we request that they rais this issu with their respect superior as you know their respons to our discuss relat to this issu was in term of csa as we are not readi for run collater oper we still do not prefer to use the csa the legitimaci of this statement is certain debat and the under reason may actual be someth entir differ includ the possibl that they mere do not want to enter into a csa with a nonfinanci institut we will continu to attempt to persuad ibj to enter into the csa with enron howev it is uncertain if this is achiev

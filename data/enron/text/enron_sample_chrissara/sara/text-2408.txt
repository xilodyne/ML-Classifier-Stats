us 100000000 jonathan whitehead has rais this issu with john suttl to receiv his20 input 20 ibj specif respons are quot below as follow part 1 a agre not includ affili of partya g we prefer to termin the transact when as a result of merger as 20 for a parti a surviv parti of such becom materi weaker than befor e part 3 we usual accept to deliv a copi the list of author signatur onli part 4 feven though delet the word not in this provis we can net the20 payment with respect to the same transact due to our system20 incap we are not abl to net the payment with respect to two or mo re20 transact in the same currenc h agre part 5 a if your suggest languag is includ a nondefault parti has to 20 continu to make payment to a default parti with no payment oblig 20 which doe not seem realist we prefer to termin transact when an 20 event of default occur we do not like to includ the provis which20 releas a technic error c agre e we propos 5 busi day instead g we do not think the definit of the affili includ a partys20 branch offic if our branch have a deal with enron japan we will amend 20 this master agreement to includ such branch as multibranch offic we hea rd20 that in most jurisdict of the world it is not effect to setoff th e20 oblig between a parti and the other parti affili i agre to includ this provis j we do not prefer that a parti could transfer it right and oblig s20 without the other parti consent to even it affili we might not get 20 approv of the transfer from our credit depart or such transfer might 20 caus an addit payment of tax or other cost k we will revert to you later m agre n agre to includ this provis part 6 we still prefer to includ the provis relat to the commodity20 transact in the respect confirm i look forward to receiv your input i note

jonathanwhiteheadenroncom kevin cordesmanhouectect steve n20 kleegehouectect tom brucejoneslonectect 0909 subject re fw ibj isda master agreement i had a brief convers this morn with john suttl credit and it 20 look like hes go to insist on the csa we are go to talk tomorrow 20 and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comment while we20 have document for transact enter into prior to execut of a20 master agreement the extent of their revis make me veri uneasi mani 20 of these point are veri serious and if they can not agre we will have20 troubl come to agreement even on the short form document it would be 20 help if they could explain the chang rather than just send us a20 markup follow are my point respons to their revis part 1 a the addit of our affili has the affect of expand the 20 possibl default too broad and we cannot agre to these chang for20 exampl this would mean that if ani enron affili went into bankruptci 20 this agreement would be in default g this provis provid addit flexibl without ani credit risk 20 to the other parti it should remain in place unless ibj can articul a 20 reason to remov it part 3 the languag insert is much to vagu our origin version spell 20 out exact what is expect of the parti if the document we list ar e20 not accept ibj should tell us now what would be accept and if we 20 agre we will put it in the agreement part 4 f by delet the word not in this provis ibj is say tha t20 payment due to each other with respect to the same transact will not ne t20 ie if we are pay fix and they are pay float we each have to 20 make the full payment to the other rather than net the two amount to o ne20 payment this is not accept h if ibj will use their ny branch as agent we should use enron corp or e na part 5 a our suggest languag allow the purchas of an option to20 receiv payment due even though technic in default under another20 provis of the agreement our posit is that if there are no other20 possibl payment requir due from the purchas the option should be 20 honor c the section we delet requir that the market maker be in the same 20 citi for mani market in which we particip it is veri difficult if n ot20 imposs to find multipl market maker in the same city20 e the chang to 10 busi day is much too long this mean we can no t20 have certainti as to the term of the transact for two week we can go 20 as high as three day if necessari but even that is beyond common market20 practic g their chang remov the abil to set off against oblig owe t o20 multipl enron compani if they default and onli allow setoff with each 20 ibj branch as a separ entiti this may not be an issu if we will never 20 trade or otherwis transact with them in ani other enron compani and if we 20 will never do busi with ani other branch of ibj we usual dont like 20 to restrict ourselv that way i we absolut insist on the confidenti of our transact if 20 there is some revis to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t20 wholesal delet is out of the question j as with part 1 g this section add flexibl to both parti while 20 maintain flexibl within the corpor famili given the frequenc 20 with which enron move busi around within the famili this section is 20 import to us k this section result from an experi we had with a counterparti tha t20 went into bankruptci and therefor default while they were in the money 20 we disput the amount owe and under the term of the agreement without o ur20 revis we would have owe them interest at their cost of fund a rath r20 high rate given their status as a bankrupt we feel the nondefault rate i s20 more appropri m i cant imagin whi they wouldnt want this section includ it20 protect us both n you know more about this than i part 6 these are all import issu for us and we can discuss them20 individu if they object for some articul reason if these provisio ns20 are not includ here they will need to be includ in each confirm a 20 signific burden for our back offic system which are not set up for it 20 and we need to know now if they object to ani of them other revis that they have made are accept unless credit object i20 hope this is help and sorri to have run on so long im happi to discus s20 ani of these issu at greater length if you want it sound to me like20 ibj expect regard execut of document are a bit high given th e20 volum and natur of their comment

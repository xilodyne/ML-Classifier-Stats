evid to ani court or in ani proceed for the purpos of establish ani matter pertin to ani transact provid howev that notwithstand the term of this claus the parti do not waiv ani right they may have under the applic rule of evid csa bii elig collater i believ we discuss ad treasuri with matur greater than one year we propos treasuri under one year with a valuat percentag of 99 15 year at 97 and 510 year at 95 csa bivb threshold pleas remov potenti event of default csa d condit preced we ask that tax event and tax event upon merger be exclud as specifi condit there is no reason to stop collater a transact upon the occurr of these event becaus if at the end of the remedi period the transact is termin then the post collater will be return if applic accord to the normal procedur of the csa if the transact is termin and the settlement amount is not paid then the nonaffect parti has the right to liquid the collater to satisfi it claim and you would want all transact includ the affect transact to be fulli collater at that time csa f disput resolut i we can agre to two local busi day to resolv a disput ii we suggest that the parti look to market standard screen befor poll dealer to determin valu this is our standard definit of valu valu for the purpos of paragraph 5ic and 5ii the valu of post collater other than cash will be equal to the sum of i the face valu of the post collater multipli by the product of a either x the close bid price as quot by bloomberg financi market or dow jone teler servic as of resolut time or y the sum of the arithmet mean of the close bid price quot by three mutuallyagre upon refer marketmak for the relev secur on the relev date and b the applic valuat percentag plus ii the accru interest on such secur except to the extent transfer to a parti pursuant to ani applic provis of this agreement or includ in the applic price refer to in i of this claus as of such date iii we can agre to transfer onli the undisput amount csa g hold and use post collater i have sever thought on this section the credit rate for a parti should includ both sp and moodi and a parti abil to hold post collater should be base on the lower of those two howev if the post collater is a letter of credit then a parti should be entitl to hold the letter of credit regardless of their credit rate under the term of gi the parti and it custodian are individu entitl to hold post collater howev there are no requir for a custodian i believ the requir of a qualifi institut should appli to the custodian if there is a rate requir for the parti in order for it to hold post collater and the parti is no longer in complianc with that rate requir then in order to compli with the general term of the csa the parti would have to transfer the post collater to a custodian which met the requir of a custodian or els it would be in breach of the agreement which would be an event of default if not remedi within 30 day therefor if you appli the requir of a qualifi institut to a custodian under gi then gii2 and 3 can be remov final we would like the requir of the custodian to be a rate of at least aa2 and have total asset of at least us 10000000000 csa hiii altern to interest amount subparagraph a should not appli in the event that the downgrad parti is the secur parti and they were at the time of downgrad hold post collater and post collater is move to a custodian there is no reason whi the pledgor who was not downgrad should be penal by not receiv interest payment in the form of cash when they are paid on the post collater as a matter of fact it is my understand that it is more difficult oper to reinvest such fund and much easier to pay them to the pledgor csa m other provis the definit of feder fund effect rate is not necessari pleas amend the definit of letter of credit to reflect the requir of the issu bank to includ a rate of aa2 and have total asset of at least us 10000000000 the definit of materi advers chang should be amend to reflect the rate of both moodi and sp exhibit a letter of credit provis b pleas delet the parenthet in line 3 to 4 and conform i to the amend definit of letter of credit with respect to the requir of the issu bank dii y should be entitl to draw under the lc in accord with the provis of paragraph 8 of the csa and not onli upon the occurr of an event of default the first sentenc of this section should be amend accord e pleas clarifi the intent of this section it is rather confus as written schedul i the statement to be present to the issu bank should conform to the circumst under paragraph 8 of the csa under which the secur parti can demand payment and not just be limit to an event of default enron gti to dljdoc enron multipledoc origin messag from sharistackenroncom smtpsharistackenroncom sent friday april 21 2000 402 pm to sdunndljcom subject isda master between ect invest and dljic hi suann i am pleas to attach the revis isda schedul and csa which contain most of the revis dlj request i would also like to let you know about the follow 1 paye tax represent i sent dljs suggest claus to my tax dept and they said that feel such languag is insuffici to permit us to not have to withhold with respect to interest and dividend payment each of which could aris dure the cours of our trade relationship my colleagu in the tax dept said he would prefer that dlj certifi that it is a foreign taxpay entitl to receiv payment under the document without reduct for withhold or other tax he said that dlj would not be abl to certifi to this if the form of the document is the usual veri broad form wherebi it permit transact of everi type both on and off market swap off market swap be swap involv a lend aspect and thus the under document might have to be curtail 2 document to be deliv for the time be i have made a refer in part 3 to corpor document to be given by dlj pleas let me know what these will be 3 calcul agent i still need to get the languag from you that make the both parti the ca 4 setoff as you request i had a look at amend our claus to more close reflect the isda setoff claus but with the inclus of the nondefault parti affili upon review the claus in the document is veri similar to the isda claus except for the 1st two sentenc which bring in the nondefault parti affili which we have agre to have the onli other sentenc in the claus that differ from the isda is the one which talk about convers of the earli termin amount our languag goe ahead and make it clear that all amount need to to be convert to the termin currenc i think that is help thus i would propos to leav the setoff claus unamend 5 secur rep we have been abl to incorpor these with just a veri few minor chang 6 resolut time csa i have discuss this with my credit offic and he think we realli do need to have at least 2 busi day to resolv a disput 7 transfer of collater all or just undisput amount unfortun my credit offic was unabl to agre to transfer the whole amount request if part of the amount is in disput 8hold use post collater i have review this and the languag we have propos goe a lot further than what is in the print csa for instanc there is object criteria contain in our languag which is help to the pledgor sinc it set out that a parti must have a certain credit rate to hold collater also it set out where collater may be held i would be happi to go through our suggest claus g and explain our reason for ask to leav our propos languag in the csa schedul the onli other document left to resolv are the guarante i look forward to receiv your comment on our i believ we agre to agre

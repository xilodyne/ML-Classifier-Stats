evanslonectect maroun j abboudylonectect subject margauxwhitew rontrinaben i want to touch base with you on some margauxrel issu for whitew and determin what the appropri cours of action is as a brief descript of the margaux transact in case you have not been updat recent the margaux transact will now occur through the synthet transfer of risk to the noteholdersmargaux equiti the method by which this occur is as follow whitew continu to hold the equiti interest in the asset exclud 56 of trakya etol approx 3125 of sutton bridg 50 of nowa sarzyna and approx 50 of teessid all of which are held by enron whitew enter into a fix for float swap with ena with whitew make a fix annual payment to ena in an amount repres the base case cash flow of the under asset and ena make a float payment to whitew that is initi equal to the fix payment from whitew but is adjust downward if certain identifi negat thing happen at the various project therebi transfer certain of the risk of the project through the float leg concurr margaux the issuer rais approx 511 mm of capit and through a wholllyown subsidiari purchas the float leg receiv from whitew for 511 mm in other word whitew enter into the swap and immedi monet it receiv to margaux the net result is that whitew receiv cash proceed up front and has a fix payment oblig to ena and ena has a float payment oblig to margaux ive attach a structur diagram below with this in mind the follow issu relat to whitew have arisen the tax group would like to character the payment ena receiv from whitew as a prefer partnership distribut see attach note from donett dewar below my question is how do we achiev this result first is whitew lp abl to enter into this transact itself or doe it need to occur at a subsidiari level in other word doe the swap fall under the definit of indebted claus viii perhap in the whitew lp agreement which is prohibit at the whitew level if it cannot is se acquisit the best candid to be ena counterparti or do we run into issu with the natwest facil although theyd like consent sinc they will get repaid out of the proceed of the transact onc the issu of who is the appropri counterparti has been determin we need to discuss the mechan by which we effect the transact if we are inde go to open up the whitew lp agreement i suspect that annmari will need to revisit the alloc and distribut section which is probabl no easi task if not and the transact will occur at a subsidiari level we need to determin where also im sure this transact will requir certificatehold approv as it is in excess of the 40mm threshold a final logist issu that donett rais in her note is who will be respons for the legal work requir at the whitew level more general are there ani other legal or other issu that you see with respect to this transact from a whitew perspect if youd like to discuss the transact further pleas let me know ill be in houston the earli part of next week so perhap we can spend some time discuss

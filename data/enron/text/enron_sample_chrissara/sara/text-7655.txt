  i am tri to distinguish these two type of entiti both practic what are we abl to negoti and legal what do we realli need in our schedul i am also interest in your experi in deal with these parti ena form of municip schedul the ena schedul was essenti taken from the 1992 isda us municip counterparti schedul the isda schedul in addit to other provis the isda schedul 1 add rep design to avoid an orang counti type meltdown and 2 incorpor the concept of incipi illeg which occur befor the termin event of illeg the incipi illeg concept is use in section 2aiii oblig as well as the section 3 rep of the isda schedul the concept is ad to the section 3b rep absenc of event of default potenti event of default incipi illeg and for purpos of notifi the other parti of it occurr interest enough the ena schedul doe not includ the section 3b rep chang i think we need to add this chang to ena schedul with respect to ious we need to clarifi our posit on regulatori develop which is actual a watereddown incipi illeg concept if such an event occur ena should be advis of the event notic but doe ena realli want the abil to termin trade at midmarket addit termin event or simpli to have this event includ as part of a section 3b rep such that the occurr of the event mere trigger an event of default at ena side of the curv for breach of the section 3b rep i have found that negoti with ious for the notic provis can be difficult extract the addit termin event is tough argu for a section 3b chang may be easier and would mirror the municip format i think ena realli need the abil to decid when to halt trade with a counterparti experienc a regulatori develop which we may onli learn about through notic from the counterparti thus i recommend that for ious we add a notic provis and section 3b rep chang incorpor our latest definit of regulatori develop but we realli have to negoti for this protect otherwis whi bother to includ this addit languag what do you think

in this same messag to make the review process a littl easier thank you inadv for your attent swap pulp paper petrochem power otc swap the central bank regul swap transact involv local financi institut act either as dealer for their own account or as intermediari to the contract parti when the financi institut act as intermediari the agreement are in fact privat agreement negoti by two nonfinanci compani but becom subject to the requir and regul normal applic to swap involv financi institut accord to regul current in forc such swap can relat to exchang rate interest rate gold and price indic all of the swap agreement involv financi institut must be regist with cetip or with anoth custodi and clear system author by the central bank or the cvm brazilian sec as a matter of practic the agreement use by the bank that particip in the swap market do not follow a standard form sinc normal each bank has a particular sampl form with which it feel more comfort deriv in addit to exchangetrad deriv and otc swap involv financi institut there is no legal impedi in principl to deriv transact be privat negoti and enter into between two interest parti as a general rule in brazil as long as no specif prohibit is found in the law parti are free to negoti agreement that best suit their interest intern hedg central bank regul author that brazilian compani enter into transact abroad either in exchang or have a financi institut as their counterpart to hedg against the fluctuat of interest rate exchang rate or commod price in the intern market such hedg transact must refer to payment in foreign currenc schedul to be made by or to the brazilian compani in respect of commerci or financi right or oblig or to payment in local currenc aris out of certain financi oblig subject

hedg exampl commod swap between two brazilian compani as per what has been said abov there is noth that preclud enron brazil of enter into a swap with anoth brazilian compani regard ani commod trade by enron pulp paper petrochem product power gas enron doe not need to be a financi institut to provid swap transact on the other hand i am not sure yet on the follow point 1 doe such swap agreement should be regist with cetip or ani other clear system to be valid under brazilian regul 2 what are the tax involv in a swap commod swap between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani this kind of deal seem to be also avail in the brazilian market and the onli differ from exampl 1 would be the fact that it must be regist with the central bank and it would involv transfer of foreign currenc commod swap between two offshor compani but involv brazilian export i am not sure if brazilian regul would have anyth to do with a transact like this one i would assum that a brazilian export would sell to their offshor subsidiari and such subsidiari would sell to their end custom enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshor subsidiari of the brazilian compani therefor enron would not have ani involv with brazilian regul becaus it would not be deal with brazil prepay pulp paper petrochem power the regul current in forc govern export prepay especi central bank of brazil cartacircular 2624 of februari 14 1996 establish that all repay of princip under such transact must necessarili be made by mean of shipment of the relev export good cartacircular 2624 allow cash remitt abroad onli in regard to payment of interest under the facil therefor it is not possibl to structur a transact where the repay of princip will be made onli in cash or where the borrow has the abil to choos between pay cash or export the good a transact that involv structur a direct loan to the brazilian compani where the valu of the princip of which would be tie to the price of the relev commod is veri difficult to be approv under a direct loan regist with the central bank the borrow may remit all due amount of princip and interest in accord with the schedul of payment attach to the certif of registr the problem with such altern is that although there are no express regul prevent it to do so the central bank will most probabl not issu a prior author for such type of loan as it onli normal issu author for normal loan where the princip is a fix amount and the interest rate is either a fix rate or a float rate normal base on libor or us treasuri it should also be note that general speak all interest payment under such an agreement are subject to withhold tax at the rate of 15 pa cc 5 account a possibl altern way to structur a prepay would be by use a nonregist loan with the central bank under such altern the fund disburs by enron under the loan would be remit to brazil through an intern transfer of brazilian currenc as allow by circular 2677 of the central bank of brazil the intern transfer of brazilian currenc intern transfer is a system which use a nonresid current account in brazil and the brazilian interbank foreign exchang market to effect remitt of fund to and from brazil under such system a lender that wish to disburs fund to a brazilian borrow make a foreign currenc deposit with a bank locat outsid of brazil offshor bank and instruct the offshor bank to deliv such dollar to a brazilian bank in exchang for brazilian currenc such brazilian currenc is then deposit in a nonresid account held by the offshor bank in brazil and thereaft transfer to the borrow the repay follow the invers procedur ie the borrow deposit the amount in a nonresid account of an offshor bank and instruct it to exchang the fund into foreign currenc and deliv them to the lender abroad the main differ between the regist loan and the nonregist loan are that the nonregist loan are not subject to prior approv by the central bank of brazil and therefor not subject to scrutini as to their minimum tenor and applic interest rate and the applic foreign exchang rate to nonregist loan is the float rate as oppos to the commerci rate of exchang all transfer of fund to brazil as intern transfer are subject to a financi transact tax iof at the rate of 2 on the amount transfer plus a bank fee that normal rang from 04 to 06 of such amount ani interest payment under a nonregist loan are subject to withhold tax at the rate of 15 or 25 if the lender is locat in a taxhaven jurisdict i dont think this type of transact is the best way to circumv some of the brazilian regul regard prepay given the bad press that deal via the cc 5 account mechan would bring to enron but i have it address just in case someon doe not share the same opinion exampl financi prepay between two brazilian compani not allow unless the compani provid the prepay qualifi as a financi institut as per brazilian law sinc it will not be the case in enron case we should not focus in these kind of transact financi prepay between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani as it has been mention befor it is allow as long as enron can structur the prepay in way where there is a preestablish amort schedul for princip and interest it is veri hard to structur a prepay with specif split between princip and interest becaus the object of the prepay is to lock on a certain volum of a product and not on a specif price therefor if enron prepay for a specif product on a float basi the attach valu of that commod can go up or down as the market fluctuat as well as the total valu associ to the deal such valu can be either princip or interest and it is imposs to determin what it will be financi prepay between two offshor compani but one be a subsidiari of a brazilian entiti i think there is no restrict in this case given the whole deal will be close offshor and the brazilian author are not go to be involv it will most like be a deal involv three parti a compani in brazil it offshor subsidiari and enron physic prepay between two brazilian compani no restrict physic prepay between a brazilian compani and an offshor compani no restrict as long as there is physic deliveri physic prepay between two offshor compani but involv brazilian export no restrict it would also involv three parti a compani in brazil it offshor subsidiari and enron thank gustavo

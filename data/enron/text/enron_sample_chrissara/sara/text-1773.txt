approv requir per section 10 b 1 the fema regul effect 1 june 2000 transfer by way of sale by a person resid outsid india of the share debentur held by him to person resid in india will requir prior permiss of rbi veena your activ chart show that form ts 1 is to be file after the sale is effect money receiv and at the time of remitt of sale proceed sinc the act prescrib prior approv we should sell onli after receipt of rbi approv and not befor the requisit form to be file for seek approv is form ts1 if we are effect the sale through a privat arrang the applic should be support with the averag quotat of the share price averag of daili high and low for one week proceed the date of applic duli certifi by a charter account if the sale propos to be effect on the floor of the exchang to the general public at the prevail market price the charter account certif is not requir sinc we intend sell at the floor this certif is not requir b thin trade i refer to veena queri on whether genesi share are thin trade per section 10 explan i the share will be treat as thin trade if the annualis trade turnov in that share on a main stock exchang in india dure the six calendar month preced the month in which the applic is made is less than 2 by number of share of the list stock though we can take a view that genesi share are list for trade onli from 5 june 2000 it is to be note that the new share issu to a the erstwhil genesi sharehold are issu as a result of the scheme of amalgam approv by the high court mumbai b the applic of the privat placement incl enron and the new amalgam compani genesi intern corpor limit whose previous name was aek trade and invest limit was a list compani at the mumbai stock exchang henc it is advis to check whether the share of aek were thin trade or not fyi the paid up equiti of aek prior to the amalgam was 240000 equiti share of rs 10 each aggreg rs 2400000 we can appli the test as explain abov on the aek share prior to genesi amalgam just to satisfi ourselv that it was not thin trade it is better to check this provis c formal for remitt per section 11of the fema regul remitt of sale proceed shall be made by a authoris dealer upon satisfi himself that the secur was held by the seller on repatri basi we need to submit the foreign collabor approv letter no 39 sianfc 99 nri to the ad submiss of the contract note of the broker effect the sale and submiss of a no object certif tax clearanc certif d incom tax noc tcc i understand from veena that there is a current think that through a charter account certif state the doubl taxat treati we need not obtain the noc of the it in my view sinc the regul stipul an noc tcc from the it depart i doubt whether it is doabl without a boc tcc of the it in the past this was follow and with an undertak from the compani support with a charter account certificateconfirm there are no tax implic in the under transact one could remit the fund without a noctcc from it but given a veri specif statement us 11 of the fema regul and the same be introduc onli from 1 june and hasnt been time test i doubt whether the authoris dealer will accept our view and effect fund transfer with an undertak and ca certif in my view noc would be a pre requisit e bank account assum that the noc is requir there will be a time differ between we receiv the sale proceed and remit the money to mauritius after obtain the noc from it it is certain not advis to hold the instrument without encash it henc open of a bank account in india to encash the instrument is warrant i refer to mike mail on allow the broker to hold the fund in a trust account for edvmhc in my view instead of the broker hold the same the ad himself can hold it on trust for edvmhc but this need to check and proper document with the bank authoris dealer and as well at edvmhc from due dilig and complianc point of view i would suggest to take the rout of open of an rupe bank account than the trust rout sinc it is not a demat share open of an custodi account is not requir this need to be check with the authoris dealer f applic to rbi ts 1 i suggest that while make the rbi applic under ts 1 it is advis to state and seek their concurr or keep them inform as to point e abov we could mention in our applic to rbi and seek approv as to a open of an rupe account or b authoris the ad to hold the same in an trust account for edvmhc rbi while accord it approv will look in to the transact and accord approv for this as well may be befor file the applic with rbi we could meet with the concern offici in exchang control depart and walk him through with the transact so that the approv is obtain at the earliest g origin fund i understand that while make this invest the fund have not come in from edvmhc mauritius or it has come from a compani from caymon island tax need to confirm whether the money receiv from cayco though on behalf of an mauritius compani would qualifi for tax benefit h confirm by genesi on non lockin there are no document avail like the board resolut while allot the share to edvmhc or the applic to stock exchang which would specifi distinct number of the lockin share nor it is state in the inform memorandum as whether share offer under this im are freeli tradabl though the sebi guidelin are clear that if the share do not form part of the promot quoto they are freeli tradabl it is advis that we take a certif from genesi on this i have spoken this with rajesh who confirm that such a certif from genesi can be otain without ani difficulti pleas feel free and do call me for ani further assist

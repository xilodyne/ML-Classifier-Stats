equiti the contract provis should put the company01s20 counterparti in no better posit than the company01 common sharehold s20 specif the eitf tentat conclud that contract in a company01 s20 own stock such as written put or forward purchas contract that come20 under the scope of issu 9613 and have net share settlement provis tha t20 keep a contract from be classifi as an asset or liabil must have th e20 follow characterist 01 otherwis the contract must be treat as an 20 asset or liabil at fair valu with chang in fair valu reported20 current in earn the contract must permit the compani to settl net in share at it option 20 in either regist or unregist share it was determin that the20 abil to deliv regist share was outsid of the control of a compan y the contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of share to be20 deliv in a net share settlement this cap must exist even if the contra ct20 termin when the stock price reach a state price trigger the need f or20 a cap was determin to be critic in determin whether a compani had20 suffici author and unissu share to settl the contract at contract incept and on an ongo basi the compani must have20 suffici author but unissu share avail to settl the contract 20 consid all other claim on author share for stock options20 convert and other transact that may requir the issuanc of stock 20 this requir was deem critic as the abil to have a request for 20 addit author share approv by the sharehold was deem outsid e20 of the control of the compani in this context the compani is defin as 20 the compani manag rather than it manag and sharehold there is no requir in the contract to post collater at ani point in 20 the contract or for ani reason there are no requir cash payment to the counterparti trueup if the n et20 share initi deliv are insuffici to provid the counterparti wit h20 full satisfact of the amount due howev trueup may be includ in t he20 contract if the compani onli not the counterparti can choos whether to 20 satisfi the trueup in share or cash and the trueup is subject to the20 explicit cap discuss in item 2 there is no econom penalti in the contract for net share settlement that 20 would econom compel the compani to settl in net cash the right to 20 increas the number of share deliv base on the fair valu differentia l20 between regist share and unregist share was not deem to be a20 penalti there are no provis in the contract that would indic the counterpart y20 had creditor right or would otherwis contraven the object of this20 model that the counterparty01 right would rank no higher than those of a20 common sharehold subject to futur eitf discuss it may be possibl 20 to meet this criterion by have a legal letter address the issu or a 20 specif statement of this concept in the contract relat issu there was also discuss of the provis relat to termin and20 settlement in the event of a merger or chang in control there was general 20 support for a posit that as long as the counterparti receiv the same 20 choic of compens as other sharehold for exampl stock for stock 20 stock and cash for stock cash for stock the fact that the counterparti 20 might receiv cash in such circumst would not preclud equiti treatmen t20 for the contract similar in the event of nation or liquid a net cash20 settlement of the same type afford a common sharehold would not preclud e20 equiti treatment for the contract in addit counterparti right that did not exceed right of common20 sharehold should be accept for exampl right to sue for damag i n20 the event of misrepresent or a breach of warrranti or if a compani 20 simpli refus to perform under the contract as long as a common sharehold er20 would also have those right with respect to event that would caus a contract that was compliant with 20 the model at incept to later becom noncompli for exampl becaus a n20 acquisit consum enough author share that otherwis were need to 20 satisfi the contract the eitf conclud that at the time the
